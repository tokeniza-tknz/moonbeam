# Compliance and Regulation

Tokeniza is built on a foundation of security and regulatory compliance. We are committed to transparency and operate in full alignment with Brazilian financial regulations.

## CVM Authorization

Tokeniza is a platform officially authorized by the **Comissão de Valores Mobiliários (CVM)**, the securities and exchange commission of Brazil.

We operate under the rules of **Instrução CVM 88** (now consolidated in Resolução CVM 187), which regulates investment crowdfunding (equity crowdfunding).

This authorization certifies that Tokeniza meets all necessary regulatory requirements to operate legally and transparently, providing investors with a secure and trusted environment.

## Commitment to Security and Audits

Our commitment to compliance extends beyond our CVM license:

* **Constant Audits:** The platform undergoes constant digital security and legal audits to ensure the highest level of integrity and protection.
* **Legal Compliance:** We conduct periodic legal audits to ensure full compliance with all applicable regulations.
* **Digital Security:** We employ advanced encryption and security protocols to protect all user data and transactions.

As a genuine blockchain-based platform, all on-chain interactions are registered on the Moonbeam blockchain, providing an immutable and verifiable hash for every operation.
